there are two ways i can make the 6502 emulator work :

(1) by keeping the opcodes as hex codes : and by using hex code 
		i dont have to worry about the addressing mode of each instruction.

(2) or by keeping the assembly as strings but than i need addressing modes
		to parse properly.	

(3)  LDA $31F6 is stored as three bytes in memory, $AD $F6 $31... low byte is stored first.
